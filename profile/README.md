Our services are tailored for streamers, developers, and content creators who demand reliability and quality in real-time information and content management tools.

## Our APIs

We provide a variety of APIs that cater to different needs. Whether you're looking for real-time weather updates, want to incorporate public quotes into your streams, or need to manage DMCA-compliant music, we've got you covered.

### Time API

Get accurate and precise time data for any time zone. Perfect for streams that engage audiences across different geographical locations.

### Weather API

Real-time weather updates at your fingertips. Integrate live weather information into your streams or applications.

### Public Quotes API

Access a vast collection of public quotes. Add depth and interest to your content with meaningful quotes.

## DMCA Music Tool

While not strictly an API, we've developed a handy tool to enhance your streaming experience by providing DMCA-compliant music. This tool functions as a browser source, easily integrated into streaming software like OBS. By adding this as a source in OBS, you can access about 5 hours of music that automatically loops once the playlist ends, ensuring your stream always has background music without risking DMCA takedown notices.

To utilize this feature, simply visit [music.yourstreamingtools.com](https://music.yourstreamingtools.com) for detailed instructions on setting up and integrating this tool into your streams.
